        The Antidote to Negative Emotions</h2>
        <p className='text-gray-600 text-left p-5 text-2xl leading-10 font-bold'>
        The fastest and most dependable way to eliminate negative emotions is to
    immediately say, “I am responsible!” Whenever something happens that
    triggers anger or a negative reaction of any kind, quickly neutralize the
    feelings of negativity by saying, “I am responsible.”
    The Law of Substitution says that you can substitute a positive thought
    for a negative one. Since your mind can hold only one thought at a time,
    when you deliberately choose the positive thought, “I am responsible,” you
    cancel out any other thought or emotion at that moment.
    It is not possible to accept responsibility and remain angry at the same
    time. It is not possible to accept responsibility and experience negative
    emotions. It is not possible to accept responsibility without becoming calm,
    clear, positive, and focused once more.
    As long as you are blaming someone else for something in your life that
    you don’t like, you will remain a “mental child.” You continue to see
    yourself as small and helpless, like a victim. You continue to lash out.
    However, when you begin to accept responsibility for everything that
    happens to you, you transform yourself into a “mental adult.” You will see
    yourself as being in charge of your own life, and no longer a victim.
    In Alcoholics Anonymous, people who are having problems with
    drinking attend meetings with others going through the same situation.
    What they have found is that until the individual accepts responsibility for
    his or her problems, both with alcohol and in other areas of life, no progress
